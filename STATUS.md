## ⏳ Current Status

The deployment is in progress. Environment variables may take a few minutes to propagate to the running deployment.

## ✅ How to Verify It's Working

After the deployment completes:

1. **Visit**: https://multisourceagent-master.vercel.app
2. **Try asking**: "What was the Q1 revenue?"
3. **Expected**: You should get an AI-generated, natural language response instead of raw JSON data

## 🔍 If It's Still Not Working

If you still see raw data after a few minutes:

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for environment variables to fully propagate
2. **Force redeploy**: 
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Deployments → Click "Redeploy" on latest
3. **Check logs**: 
   - Vercel Dashboard → Logs
   - Look for any API errors

## 🎉 What You'll Get

Once working:
- ✅ **Fast AI responses** (Groq is very fast)
- ✅ **Free** (no cost)
- ✅ **Natural language** answers
- ✅ **30 requests/minute** free tier
